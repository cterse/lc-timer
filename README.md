## How to load extension for testing
If you're not on Windows and if Chrome is available for your OS, chances are that your version of Chrome allows loading packaged extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store. You can then just download the `.crx` extension file present in the `lc-timer/package` directory and drag-drop it onto the Chrome's **Extensions** page (`chrome://extensions`) and the extension will be installed.

### For Window's users:
1. Clone the lc-timer repository.
2. Use the `master` branch, or switch to `activedev` branch for latest updates.
3. Open up Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Turn on **Developer Mode** on the upper-right corner.
5. If you're on Windows, manually installing the `.crx` package won't work. Instead, just drag and drop the `lc-timer` directory (i.e. the entire extension code directory) into the **Extensions** page. You can also select the directory using the **Load Unpacked** button available in the **Extensions** page.
